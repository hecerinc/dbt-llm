      "Therapist: Hello and welcome! I'm glad you're here to explore Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) skills. Is there a particular DBT skill or technique you're interested in practicing today, or would you like me to suggest one based on what you're experiencing currently?\n",

      "Client: My grandmother passed away two days ago and everyone in my family has been busy grieving so I've been picking up all the preparations for her wake. I haven't had a chance to stop but if I don't take care of everything, I don't think anyone else will.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therapist: I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy burden during this tough time. Grief can be overwhelming, and it's important to take care of yourself too. How are you currently feeling in this moment as you handle these responsibilities?\n",
      "\n",
      "Client: Thank you for your kind words. I'm feeling incredibly overwhelmed and exhausted. It's like I'm running on autopilot, trying to keep it all together for my family's sake, but inside I'm just a mix of sadness and stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therapist: It's completely natural to feel overwhelmed and exhausted under such circumstances; your emotions are valid. Given how you're feeling, it might be helpful to practice a skill that can help you manage overwhelming emotions and stress. Would you like to explore a skill that can provide some immediate relief or one that can help manage your emotions more long-term?\n",
      "\n",
      "Client: I think something for immediate relief would be good. I need to stay functional for the wake, but also need a way to cope with these intense emotions right now. What do you suggest?\n",
      "\n",
      "Therapist: For immediate relief, the DBT skill called \"TIPP\" can be highly effective. This stands for Temperature, Intense exercise, Paced breathing, and Paired muscle relaxation. It's designed to help quickly reduce emotional arousal. To start, would you be willing to try a technique involving temperature, such as holding a cold ice pack, to see if it helps you feel a little more grounded and present?\n",
      "\n",
      "Client: Yes, that sounds doable. I'll grab an ice pack from the freezer and hold it. What should I do next?\n",
      "\n",
      "Therapist: Great, once you have the ice pack, hold it in your hands or against your face for a few moments. Focus on how the cold feels against your skin. This can help to interrupt overwhelming emotions. As you're doing this, notice your body's responses—any changes in your breathing, heart rate, or the tension in your muscles. Take a few deep breaths as you hold the ice pack. How are you feeling now?\n",
      "\n",
      "Client: The cold is definitely a shock to the system. It's making me feel more alert. My breathing slowed down a bit because I'm focusing on the sensation. It's a brief distraction from everything else, which is kind of nice, actually.\n"

Take a few deep breaths as you hold the ice pack. How are you feeling now?\n",
